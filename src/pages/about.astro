	<Title type="h1">About Me</Title>
	<p>Hello again! My name is Atakan, I am <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> who lives in Ankara, Turkey. I have this strange passion about making and breaking things on the world wide web. Even tough I have a bachelor degree on socialogy, I rather examine, research and fix the codebase issues than the society.</p>
	<p>I have started interacting with website development <strong>as early as 2012</strong>, and I am developing websites and web apps since then.</p>
	<p>My primary expertise is in developing <strong> WordPress-based solutions</strong> for the range of businesses from startups to enterprises. I am also quite <strong>obsessed about web performance</strong>, so you may guess how I am looking JS-based solutions nowadays.</p>
	<p>Besides brainstorming for new projects, I am trying really hard to investing time for my open-source <a href="/projects">projects</a> in my spare time.</p>
	<p>Currently I am stretching the limits of WordPress at <strong>Invicti Security</strong>.</p>
